In the midst of Zoom meetings, I found myself thinking more and more about the virtual backgrounds and how they are rendered.  After lots of thinking, I decided I first wanted to try a different project to see how OpenCV worked.  I built this drawing tool while live-streaming to my high school robotics team, which made it all the more fun when my code did not run.
