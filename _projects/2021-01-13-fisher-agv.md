For the past year and a half, I have been leading the development of custom autonomously guided vehicles at Fisher Dynamics.  After seeing demonstrations of various AGVs, I was fixated on the high cost. Throughout my time at Fisher, I implemented "local GPS" using digital signal processing, LIDAR and RFID scanners for navigation and state control, and a centralized server that could handle the hundred requests our devices threw at it every second.  While much of my work is covered by an NDA, <a href="mailto:cmaks@umich.edu">you can contact me</a> to see approved pictures and videos.
