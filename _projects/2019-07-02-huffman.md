Over the summer, I worked on several small projects with a <a href="https://schemberizer.github.io/Personal-Website/" target="_blank">close friend of mine, Josh.</a> This script takes text files as inputs, creates a Huffman tree and special binary, and outputs it as a text file.  Another script is able to read that tree and convert it back to the text file. For high-frequency characters, the length of the binary will be much shorter.  Clicking these images redirects to text documents, but you can also see some more <a href="https://www.github.com/claymaks/Binary-Tree-Compression" target="_blank"> on my github.</a>
