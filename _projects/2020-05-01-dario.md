When quarantine first began, my roommates and I wanted to start a 
project to keep our minds busy.  We quickly identified a shared 
pain point: setting up meetings with other students took way too 
long.  Much of it was guessing when they were free and proposing 
times we thought might work, which resulted in lots of back and 
forth.  This shared annoyance became the origin of <a href="https://schedulewithdario.com" target="_blank">
Dario</a>.  Dario 
is a conversational, personal assistant that people can text to 
help them better schedule meetings.  After sending a text 
("Schedule a meeting with Alice, Bob, and Charlie sometime 
in the next two weeks"), Dario checks your calendar and 
contacts the meeting participants to determine the best time 
available for everyone.  What began as a weeklong hackathon 
before everyone went home for the semester turned into an 
ongoing passion project that we aspire to convert into a 
full-fledged business.

On the back end, I was instrumental to creating our core infrastructure: 
writing our OAuth2 service, Google Calendar library, smart contact lookup, 
and central broker (responsible for handling the incoming 'make meeting' request,
contacting all the participants, and handing off the final meeting objects).
