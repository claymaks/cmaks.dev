My junior year of high school, I made a <a href="https://github.com/claymaks/Scouting" target="_blank">web app</a>
for my robotics team.  It was made to work offline using the cache manifest. In addition, we needed to be able to store the data and transfer it later. To do this, it automatically exports to the native mail app, where it can be 
saved as a draft.  These were all sent later and parsed using Python.  Click 
the image below to try it out!
