As it turns out, my room walls are very poorly insulated, meaning I have to run a space heater throughout the day.  I was curious to see how my room's temperature decreased with the outside temperature and how quickly the space heater could heat my room.  You can see the site <a href="http://cmaks-weather.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank"> here</a>.  Note that Heroku takes about 15 seconds to wake up, and the data is located between October 19th 2020 and October 25th 2020.
