For the past seven months, I have been leading the development of custom autonomously guided
vehicles at Fisher Dynamics.  I've implemented several communication protocols to interface
multiple microcontrollers and microcomputers, interfaced with and created my own vision
 systems for safety, and created custom servers to handle requests coming from the
 worker stations going to the AGV.  This is by far the biggest project I have undertaken,
 and one that I am most proud of.  If you have any questions or would like to see videos,
