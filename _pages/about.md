### Hi, I'm Clay!
I’m a Junior studying Computer Science and Mathematics at the 
University of Michigan. I started programming PLC-based factory 
machines freshman year of high school and quickly developed a 
passion for improving efficiency. My background is in robotics 
and autonomous systems, and I am currently working at Fisher 
Dynamics, leading the development of their <a href="/projects/fisher-agv" >
autonomously guided vehicle system</a>. Fixated on automating away my life, I founded <a href="/projects/dario" >Dario LLC</a> 
with my roommates to better schedule meetings.  

I’m incredibly passionate about the work that I do and love 
working with people who allow that passion to grow. I’m 
currently looking for opportunities that will allow me to 
develop my abilities using computer vision and programming 
autonomous systems.

<a href="mailto:cmaks@umich.edu">Contact me</a> if you'd like to work together on a project!
